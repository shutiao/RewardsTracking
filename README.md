# ForgingAheadWithDotNetMvc-CourseSampleCode
This is a combination of the Try .Net MVC slides and challenges

## How to run this project

To run this code, just clone the repo and make sure you've got the following installed:

1. An IDE or text editor (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is what I used to update this project)
2. .NET Core, which you can directly from Microsoft's [.NET Core download page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
3. If you're running from command line, goto to the project's root directory and type `dotnet restore` first, and then `dotnet run` to build and run the application so that it's available locally at http://localhost:5000.

## Post Course Challenge

If you look in the root of this repository I've added a "Post Course Challenge". This is purely for fun for those who would like to complete this project. Just check out the PostCourseChallenge.md file for details on the challenge. (Note: this is just for fun, as well as exposing you to a typical task you might do as a software developer)

## .NET auto-generated README

When you create a .NET project from a template, it auto-generates a README.  We've left the contents of that README below in case you're interested.  Have fun!
