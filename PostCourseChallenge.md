# ForgingAheadWithDotNetMvc-CourseSampleCode-PostCourseChallenge
This is a fun challenge for anyone interested in attempting it. Note: this isn't for any kind of credit, badges, etc. It's strictly to get you thinking about what's next.

## Your Challenge is to "Complete" this application

In it's current state this application doesn't fullfil it's intended purpose to our end user. (the people playing their table top RPG)

###Our goals were as follows...
- [ ] Be able to add Characters
- [ ] Be able to reuse those characters between multiple games
- [ ] Be able to add Equipment
- [ ] Be able to reuse that equipment between multiple games
- [ ] Be able to add Equipment to Characters
- [ ] Be able to add Quests
- [ ] Be able to reuse those quests between multiple games
- [ ] Be able to add Players to Quests

We did meet most of our goals but we never actually built out the functionality to let us add characters to our quests or add equipment to our characters. In addition to this our Equipment details view looks terrible.

###Your Challenge is to impliment the following
- [ ] Clone or Fork this repository so you can make changes of your own
- [ ] Change our database from "InMemory" to "SQLLite" (or whatever you prefer)
- [ ] Add a View that lets you add equipment to our characters
- [ ] Add an action to add a piece of equipment to a character
- [ ] Add a View that lets you add charcters to our quests
- [ ] Add an action to add a character to a quest
- [ ] Make the Equipment Details view nicer
- [ ] Have fun!

(Note: While the course covers most of what you need to do this, I strongly recommend reviewing the watch us build on this course to give you a better step by step before attempting this challenge)
